# Docker Compose configuration for Weather Data Pipeline
# Orchestrates PostgreSQL database and future services (Airflow, Streamlit)

version: '3.8'

services:
  # PostgreSQL Database Service
  # This is our data warehouse that stores raw and transformed weather data
  postgres:
    # Using Alpine variant for smaller image size (~80MB vs ~300MB for standard postgres)
    # Alpine is a minimal Linux distribution that reduces attack surface and deployment time
    image: postgres:15-alpine

    container_name: weather_postgres

    # Expose PostgreSQL on default port 5432
    # Format: host_port:container_port
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

    # Environment variables loaded from .env file
    # These configure the initial database, user, and password
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}

    # Volume mounts for initialization and data persistence
    volumes:
      # init_db.sql runs automatically when the container first starts
      # It creates our schema (tables, indexes) for weather data storage
      # This file is executed by docker-entrypoint-initdb.d on first initialization
      - ./sql/init_db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init_db.sql

      # Named volume for persistent data storage
      # Without this, all data would be lost when the container stops
      # This ensures our weather data persists across container restarts
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    # Health check to verify PostgreSQL is ready to accept connections
    # pg_isready is a PostgreSQL utility that checks if the server is accepting connections
    # This prevents other services (like Airflow) from trying to connect before DB is ready
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB}" ]
      interval: 10s # Check every 10 seconds
      timeout: 5s # Wait 5 seconds for response
      retries: 5 # Retry 5 times before marking as unhealthy
      start_period: 10s # Grace period before starting health checks

    # Always restart the container if it stops
    # Ensures database availability even after system reboots or crashes
    restart: always

    # Connect to custom network for inter-service communication
    networks:
      - weather_network

# Named volumes for persistent data storage
# These volumes persist even when containers are removed
volumes:
  postgres_data:
    # Stores PostgreSQL data files
    # Location on host: Docker's volume directory (managed by Docker)

    # Custom bridge network for service communication
    # Services on the same network can communicate using service names as hostnames
    # Example: Airflow can connect to PostgreSQL using hostname "postgres"
networks:
  weather_network:
    driver: bridge
